# Unreal Engine Development Plugin for Vim

vim-unreal is a plugin for working with Unreal Engine 4 projects using Vim. It
consists of:

- [ue4cli](https://docs.adamrehn.com/ue4cli/overview/introduction-to-ue4cli)
  command wrappers.
- quickfix errorformat support for Unreal Header Tool, Unreal Build Tool, and
  Microsoft Visual C++.
- [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) snippets for UE4 C++

For more information, see [vim-unreal.txt](doc/vim-unreal.txt).

Also see [vim-cpp](https://github.com/drichardson/vim-cpp), a generic C++ (not
UE specific) quality of life plugin that supports clang-format and quick
switching between header and implementation files.
